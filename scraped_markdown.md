## Webinar Video: Ayurveda Cooking Demonstration

The Ayurveda medicine that we drink (Decoctions, powders and pills and sweet elixirs) are plant-based. Individually and in combination these plants have unique properties that help in preventing and curing disease. Ayurveda food is also plant-based. And each of these plants and their combinations have medicinal values. This is why we hear from the physicians that “we are what we eat” or more precisely “we are what we digest” When the food is fresh, cooked with compatible ingredients and prepared in accordance with the principles of Ayurveda, food becomes medicine. Medicine becomes food and nourishment.

In this webinar, we share with you some of the dishes you have come to love at Barberyn Kurakkan Roti, Lunumiris, and rice flour pudding. They are easy to make, nourishing, wholesome and tasty. Try making them and you will taste your reward.

# Barberyn Beach Ayurveda Resort,    Your journey to health and well-being has never been clearer.

## Authentic Ayurveda on the beach helps you regain your health.

In a serene entrance pavilion, you are greeted with the perfume of frangipani and a traditional “Ayubowan – May you have a long life”. In a breathtaking location overlooking the Indian Ocean, you are taking the first steps discovering the quiet elegance of Barberyn Beach – and the Ayurveda way of life.

**Contemporary architecture blends beautifully with indigenous design to create a feeling of space and light, letting in nature – so guests can better enjoy the healing that comes from within.**

## **Perfect Ayurveda holidays at Barberyn Beach**

**Ochre-colored guest rooms blend harmoniously with the natural surroundings.**

Clusters of rooms stand on stilts, in the lush valley, sloping down to the sea. All the rooms have balconies and are connected by corridors. Ramps help guests walk from the accommodation to the main service building and the health centre. The ramps ensure wheelchair access.

All resort buildings, restaurants and guest rooms are built against the hillside, facing the Indian Ocean, with panoramic views of the garden and the sea.

At the highest point on the land, where Barberyn Beach Ayurveda Resort is located, an open entrance pavilion looks over the grounds, towards the sea. The pavilion is a place for our guests to gather and listen to music, particularly as the evening gives way to the night, and stars light the huge skies.

## **Barberyn Beach –**   **the Architecture & the Landscape**

The architects of Barberyn Beach Ayurveda Resort provided the following comments on the selection of the building site:

“The chosen site is ideally located on a small hill overlooking the sea, gradually sloping towards the beach. It has an extraordinary view on its southern boundary. Visitors to the hotel approach the zenith of the site, which slopes down to the sea, flanked by two beautiful verdant valleys on the east and west. There is a secluded beach at the end of the eastern valley. On the west, activities such as stilt fishing can be observed. Walking and jogging can be done on this stretch of beach as well.”

#### More information

Three architects contributed to the design and construction of Barberyn Beach, working closely with the owners who wanted to extend the same concept as its sister resort, Barberyn Reef. The architects all brought their unique qualities to the project. They had a common understanding that the barriers between interior and exterior should be minimal, and that the harmony between building and site should be maintained. All of them took care not to disturb the existing vegetation of the site. They used natural local material wherever possible. The result of this joint endeavor is the unique architecture of Barberyn Beach.

- The lead architect, Mr. Turner Wickramasinghe, believed in wide open spaces, clean lines and an uncluttered look.
- Laki Senanayake’s specialty is landscaping. His hand can also be seen in the finishes and interiors. He believed that the inside and the outside should become one. The landscape should be free to invade the interiors, wherever possible. Both architects were close associates of the famous Sri Lankan architect, Geoffrey Bawa.
- The consulting architects, Glen and Carol Smith of Glen Smith Associates in Australia, brought their love for minimalist architecture and interiors to Barberyn Beach.

The extensive grounds of Barberyn Beach Ayurveda Resort, the verdant valley and the unspoiled coastline create a feeling of space where life slows down to allow the visitor to absorb what nature bestowed.

Still and moving water brings the watering hole into focus. It attracts local bird life as well as butterflies. It is also a water reservoir for the garden. The salt-water swimming pool overlooks the ocean. Guests enjoy yoga sessions and practice at sunrise and sundown.

The land slopes to the beach and the sea. On the left hand side of the property, we find Red Cliff Bay, where guests swim at designated times, depending on the tide. On the right hand side of the property is Palm Beach, ideal for walking or jogging.

## **Food and dining, Ayurveda style**

Food is an important aspect of any vacation. The Barberyn chefs and the Ayurveda health centre work closely together to bring you a variety of wholesome and delicious meals. You’ll be amazed how good Ayurvedic food tastes.

Food is an integral part of Ayurveda therapy. Guests use their time at Barberyn to get to know the links between food and health, and their own unique system of digestion. Doctors are always ready to explain what type of vegetables and fruits to have – and which to avoid. While taking herbal medicine, it is important to abide by the Ayurveda doctors’ advice.

#### More information

### The Dining Room

The dining room enjoys a prime location on the fourth floor of the main building, with views of the verdant trees and ocean on one side and the distant hills on the other. The building has a lift and connects to the accommodation buildings through wide ramps providing wheelchair access. The dining room is open on both sides. Guests linger over meals, enjoy the views and listen to the calls of the birds.

The day starts with tropical fresh fruit and fruit juices, herbal and Sri Lankan black tea, yoghurt, eastern and western bread, as well as traditional breads and yams and nourishing congee with different kinds of leaves – “the green soup” (it also aids digestion).

The highlight of the lunch buffet is a range of vegetables, cooked in different ways, and fresh fish, followed by fruit, curd (similar to yogurt) and treacle. There is also dessert for all those who are not watching their weight.

Dinner is a set meal: soup, or entree, main course and dessert. Guests can select to have the vegetarian main course or the fish option.

Saturday evening is “Sri Lanka night”. Wonderful Sri Lankan food – some of it cooked right at the buffet table – and oriental music, played by a group of traditional musicians.

Barberyn Beach Ayurveda Resort is located on the southern tip of Sri Lanka, near the village of Weligama, 140 km south of Colombo.

Barberyn Ayurveda Resorts are the pioneers of Ayurvedic tourism in Sri Lanka and founders of the first Ayurveda resort ever, in 1984.

- **Tours of Sri Lanka**
- **Tourist attractions**

## EXCURSIONS / Day Trips   Excursions around Weligama

Barberyn Beach Ayurveda Resort arranges short excursions to places of interests on most afternoons during the week. These excursions are free of charge to resident guests.

##### Currently, the following tours are available at the resort:

- ##### “Matara Tour” – Veherahena Temple, Dondra Temple and Lighthouse at Dondra

- ##### “Galle Tour” – Old Dutch Fort

- ##### Koggala Museum

- ##### The markets and bazars around Weligama
#### More information

Weligama is situated at the southern tip of Sri Lanka, about 15 miles (24 km) from the historic city of Galle. Half an hour’s drive, along the scenic coastal route, brings you to Galle.

Weligama itself is known for its beautiful sun-drenched beaches – and the spectacular sight of stilt fishermen, whom you will not find anywhere else on the island.

The stilt fishermen have a unique style of fishing: it involves casting their lines from a perch on a sturdy pole, 20-50 meters out into the sea. Nobody knows how or why they created this unusual technique, but it seems to work. The stilts are passed on from generation to generation, and they are jealously guarded.

Weligama has a long history. The famous Kustarajagala is a rock carving, depicting a Bodhisatva (potential Buddha) Avalokitheswara. The rock carving dates back some 1500 years, and is surrounded in myth and legend.

Our guests can also arrange the following special day trips from the resort, for an extra charge.

### Mulkirigala rock temple

Described as the “little Sigiriya”, Mulkirigala consists of a series of rock monasteries carved out of the face of a huge outcrop, built during the 2nd century BC.

It is a mixture of religious and secular (non-religious) paintings and sculptures, with several reclining Buddhas among them. The beautiful paintings are based on stories connected with the past lives of the Buddha.

### Udawalawe National Park

Mulkirigala is located in the South East of Sri Lanka. It is a major eco-tourism destination. The game park is famous for its elephants, water buffalo, monitor lizards, sambar dear and the occasional leopard. It is also an exciting location for bird watching enthusiasts.

The “Lonely Planet” guide book states that the park “rivals the fauna reserves of Africa”. The park’s 30,821 hectares are located around the large Udawalawe Reservoir, which is fed by the Walawe river.

Today, on the special occasion of our beloved Director Geetha’s birthday, we had the honor of planting a sacred Bo sapling, a heartfelt gift from the Agrabodhi Temple in Weligama to Barberyn. This sapling traces its roots back to the Sri Maha Bodhi tree, where the Buddha attained enlightenment, brought to Sri Lanka by Saṅghamittā, an Indian Buddhist nun believed to be the eldest daughter of Emperor Ashoka. This tree is not only the closest authentic living link to Gautama Buddha but also the oldest human-planted tree in the world, with a known planting date and recorded history.   Surrounded by love and togetherness, this moment reminded us of our shared journey toward Wisdom, Peace, and Spiritual Awakening, values that the Bo tree beautifully symbolizes. 🌿✨ . #BoSaplingPlantation #BarberynAyurvedaResorts #authenticayurveda

Meditation & Spiritual Activities \| Barberyn Ayurveda Resorts

# Amongst the seekers

# Amongst the seekers

## Spiritual practices have always been central to the lifestyles of the people who own and manage Barberyn Ayurveda Resorts. Traditional Buddhist customs are preserved at the resort, and guests are free to participate.

### Following are some of the activities that take place at Barberyn Reef. Attendance is purely voluntary.

### **Offering of Buddha Puja**

The staff offers Buddha Puja three times a day at the roof top shrine room. Symbolic alms (Buddha Puja) have been offered to this statue of the Buddha, which has been in the Rodrigo family in an unbroken tradition, for over 90 years.

### **Chanting of Pirith**

Barberyn has a close rapport with the temples in the surrounding areas. Monks come to the resorts often, to chant Pirith and receive alms.

### **Alms giving at Barberyn**

Monks are regularly offered alms at both our resorts. The tradition of sending alms (food and gifts) to the temples on the 10th day of each month, in memory of the founders of Barberyn, has been maintained since the mid 1990’s.

On the first of these occasions,the venerable monk Bibelé Nandasara, addressing the gathering of staff and overseas guests, said “To be in a place where the words of truth are heard so often, where alms are offered to the disciples of the Buddha, and to be in a tranquil surrounding such as this, you are truly fortunate human beings!”

### Dhamma talks and meditation

Experienced teachers explain Buddhist philosophy and conduct meditation classes, held once a week. Guests are free to practice at their leisure. Three main meditative approaches are offered:

_Breathing-oriented meditation_ (such as Buddhist Satipatthanameditation), which helps to concentrate andopen a new perceptual channel in the mind.

Meditation that develops _self awareness and consciousness_ (such as Buddhist Vipassana meditation).

_Loving-kindness meditation_ (such as the Buddhistmetta meditation) which, as the name suggests, promotes kindness and compassion towards oneself and others.

These spiritual activities are integral to the Barberyn way of life.They create an environment where even the most “stressed out” guests feel the quiet energy of the place and begin to see that true contentment and happiness come from within.

## Webinar Video: Practice Yoga Asana with Amesh

At Barberyn Beach Ayurveda Resort we conduct daily yoga classes in the morning and evening for beginners and intermediate students. Our yoga teachers are qualified from the Sivananda School of Hatha Yoga.

Barberyn Yoga class is designed to complement the Ayurveda treatments. We mainly focus on synchronizing the breathing and yoga posture. For experienced yogis, they can hold the Yoga Asana for a longer period as long as they’re comfortable. Our teachers emphasize on proper relaxation, at the beginning, end and in between yoga postures to improve mental relaxation, reduce stress, prevent formation of lactic acid and prevent fatigue after class. Our guests who practice daily yoga feel energized, more focused and do not feel tired after the class. Practicing daily yoga asana and pranayama helps Ayurveda medicine to become more effective in treating certain conditions such as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Constipation, Stress, Insomnia and it makes you happy.

What is the minimum stay at one of the Barberyn Resorts?

To obtain the best results of an Ayurveda treatment plan we recommend you stay for a minimum of 2 weeks. However, if you are unable to stay for 2 weeks or you are new to Ayurveda and would like to try it out, we can receive you for one week.

As a beginner to Ayurveda how would the day be like at the resort?

Once you arrive at Barberyn resorts you will have an initial one on one consultation with our qualified Ayurveda doctors who will draw up a personalized treatment plan according to your medical evaluation. The treatment plan would include daily head, face and synchronized body oil treatment (massage with two therapists), herbal bath or herbal steam bath, fresh herbal decoctions, Herbal elixirs, acupuncture. Our doctors will also guide you on the best food practices and what and what not to eat during the treatment plan. Yoga, spiritual activities and short excursions (on some days) will also be a part of your daily activities.

Can Ayurveda specifically treat my illness?

Ayurveda can be used to treat the symptoms of many diseases as well as to help strengthen your immune system for better health.

If you have any specific medical condition, the physicians will explain to you how the condition is understood in Ayurveda, its signs and symptoms, the stage of the disease, relieving and aggravating factors, what is beneficial and what is not, and – most importantly – what would be the best line of management of the condition.

Paralysis, Parkinson’s, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, stress, depression, burn-out, sleep disorders are a few of the illnesses treated at our resorts. Please write to us with your requirement and we will be happy to assist you.

Yes. Ayurveda has a preventive and curative aspect. You can have Ayurveda treatment to maintain and enhance your health through purification and rejuvenation.

Is Ayurveda food different to normal food?

The food is cooked according to the principles of Ayurveda. We avoid using tomatoes, seasoning and artificial flavoring etc.

The Ayurveda medicine that we drink (Decoctions, powders and pills and sweet elixirs) are plant-based. Individually and in combination these plants have unique properties that help in preventing and curing disease. Ayurveda food is also plant-based. And each of these plants and their combinations have medicinal values. This is why we hear from the physicians that “we are what we eat” or more precisely “we are what we digest” When the food is fresh, cooked with compatible ingredients and prepared in accordance with the principles of Ayurveda, food becomes medicine. Medicine becomes food and nourishment.

In this webinar, we share with you some of the dishes you have come to love at Barberyn Kurakkan Roti, Lunumiris, and rice flour pudding. They are easy to make, nourishing, wholesome and tasty. Try making them and you will taste your reward.

### Manick – How to Cook Healthy & Tasty Food

- We have come to this point of culinary development from a diet of mainly raw leaves.
- In the early times we adopted a simple style of cooking which was boiling all the ingredients together and this still remains with the Soup which is also a basic dish in the west.
- Bringing the food to a boiling point and simmering on low heat is the basis of Sri Lanka cuisine and the curry, as with the soup. Coconut milk and the spices add flavor and nutrition to the Curry.
- Rice also follows this same method. People are moving away from this slow-cooking methods
- Because of the fast pace of life and we are fortunate that the method still prevails and there is a greater awareness in preserving the value and nourishment of the ingredients.

# Barberyn WAVES Ayurveda Resort,    Sri Lanka's finest health resort specializing in Ayurveda.

# Barberyn WAVES Ayurveda Resort,    Sri Lanka's finest health resort specializing in Ayurveda.

## Authentic Ayurveda on the beach in a luxurious resort.

## Helps you regain your health and strength while being pampered in a breathtaking environment.

**When we first came across the land where Barberyn Beach and Barberyn Waves are built, we could see that it was a place where the five elements of the universe – as described in Ayurveda: Apo (heat), Thejo (Water), Vayo (air), Pruthuvi (earth) and Akash (sky) – came together. The design concept of Barberyn Waves combines these five elements in perfect balance.**

The warm glow of the sun, the turquoise waters of the ocean, the feeling of space and light. the old trees around which the buildings curve and the vast skies pervade the spaces inside and out. Beautiful wood was sourced from all parts of the island. Barberyn’s own carpenters hand-made all of the doors and windows, carvings as well as the contemporary and traditional furniture. Barberyn guests – artists and designers – contributed their artful ideas, some even helped to execute it. Wall spaces now have abstract and ethnic cement renderings, they are adorned with paintings form the East and the West. Laki Senanayake’s reflective water features add cool repose. Natural fabrics, silk, cotton, hand-made lace and screen prints bring enchantment and style. This beautiful place is a healing space where guests and staff come together to practice Ayurveda, Yoga, Meditation and share the wisdom of the East and the West.

All rooms at Barberyn Waves are furnished with natural materials mainly woodwork, lovingly handcrafted by the Barberyn team of carpenters. The furniture has been specially designed for Barberyn Waves, to complement the architecture and also capture the classical style and technique of Sri Lankan furniture making. Our father-and-son team has been working with Barberyn for over 15 years.

Barberyn Waves’ rooms sizes range from 63 square metres to 81 square metres. They are spacious, rich in natural light and ventilation, and all have en-suite bathrooms. The wide open rooms with their high ceilings use neutral colours – to blend in with nature and further deepen the connection between nature and ourselves. Air-conditioned rooms are available upon request only, most guests prefer natural ventilation – which is also the recommendation during Ayurveda treatment. All rooms have a standing fan that can be used as preferred.

About Ayurveda

Treated Illnesses

## Around the resort

Barberyn Waves is located on the Southern tip of Sri Lanka, near the coastal town of Weligama, best known for its beaches. The newest addition to Barberyn, and adjacent to Barberyn Beach, Waves offers real luxury, in a mixture of contemporary and classic style.

The whole resort has been built on stilts, without disturbing the ground that it sits on, around old medicinal trees. Water features include reflective ponds and a vertical water garden, created by famous Sri Lanka artist Laki Senanayake. The resort is surrounded with countless trees and shrubs that actually have Ayurvedic medicinal properties.

Barberyn Waves’ own Ayurveda Medical Health Centre is high up in the building and very spacious. Elevated ramp walkways provide easy access to treatment areas. The stunning restaurant on the top floor captures the the view of all the green terrain around as well as a fabulous 180˚ sea view. The Yoga and Meditation Pavilion, also on the top, has a vaulted ceiling paneled with wood and looks onto a white stone Buddha statue and the ocean, its silence providing the perfect place for quiet reflection.

## Yoga & Meditation

In the eyes of Ayurveda, one’s mental wellness complements physical wellness. Keeping this in mind, Barberyn encourages its guests to engage in Yoga practices daily and meditation practices weekly.

Barberyn practices mainly traditional Hatha Yoga (postures) with Pranayama (breathing). It is designed to awaken the Kundalini (third eye) which helps to elongate the spine. If you can keep the spine supple, it helps delay the ageing process. Our yoga teachers say “You are as old as your spine”.

At Barberyn, yoga is for everyone, there is no pressure to compete. Therefore, yoga classes are designed to cater to beginners and advanced students alike, so no one feels left out. The complimentary yoga classes for resident guests help to bring tranquility and stillness, which in turn enhance consciousness. The Ayurveda physicians recommend at least one yoga session per day, when you want to achieve the best results during your stay.

The large yoga pavilion is built from natural material. It has a 180-degree sea view, and is a unique location to practice yoga, connect with your inner self and develop better consciousness.

## Webinar Video: Ayurveda Cooking Demonstration

The Ayurveda medicine that we drink (Decoctions, powders and pills and sweet elixirs) are plant-based. Individually and in combination these plants have unique properties that help in preventing and curing disease. Ayurveda food is also plant-based. And each of these plants and their combinations have medicinal values. This is why we hear from the physicians that “we are what we eat” or more precisely “we are what we digest” When the food is fresh, cooked with compatible ingredients and prepared in accordance with the principles of Ayurveda, food becomes medicine. Medicine becomes food and nourishment.

In this webinar, we share with you some of the dishes you have come to love at Barberyn Kurakkan Roti, Lunumiris, and rice flour pudding. They are easy to make, nourishing, wholesome and tasty. Try making them and you will taste your reward.

The practice ofMindfulnessis known to help in resolving common human problems such as stress, anxiety and depression. and help in personality development. These are however fringe benefits in the practice. Mindfulness is, in fact, a spiritual journey that focuses on the deep interconnection between the body and the mind. Mindfulness leads to awareness and this leads to insight – a profound level of understanding that is beyond intellect and can only be known through experience.

Geetha explains this philosophy in a simple and practical way.

## Meditation on Loving Kindness with Geetha

This is the video of Geetha’s guided Loving Kindness meditation from Sunday, May 3rd, 2020 – the first Webinar in a series that will continue throughout May 2020, every Sunday, at 11am European Summer Time/10am UK.

Meditation on loving-kindness helps us to overcome emotions such as anger, fear, anxiety which we are all experiencing and which is said to lower immunity. Awakening the compassion within us results in protection for ourselves.

**Understanding Loving Kindness Meditation.**

In meditation we seek to come to the present moment – to be “conscious”. In this meditation,  we focus on our breath, and it helps us to become still and calm.

Once we find our breath and focus on it for a little while, we turn our attention to Loving Kindness – it brings Peace and Strength to the giver and the receiver. We start by feeling kind to ourselves and then move on to our parents, our teachers, our close family, our friends, our enemies and then to the whole wold.  We then bring back all that good energy and loving kindness to ourselves again. You hear four lines being repeated starting with our selves.

May I be well

## The original home of authentic Ayurveda in Sri Lanka

Find yourself and heal your body, mind, and spirit – in the holistic experience of Ayurveda, meditation and yoga, in this unique Ayurveda resort overlooking the ocean. Join like-minded guests at the original home of Sri Lanka Ayurveda in Beruwala.

Barberyn Reef welcomes its guests with warmth and a quiet competence that few resorts can match – with more than 50 years of fine hospitality, more than 25 of these fully dedicated to Ayurveda.

Barberyn Ayurveda Resorts are the founders of the first Ayurveda resort ever, in 1984, and thus pioneers of Ayurvedic tourism in Sri Lanka.

## AS CLOSE TO NATURE AS ONE CAN GET

Barberyn Reef welcomes its guests with warmth and a quiet competence that few resorts can match – with more than 40 years of fine hospitality, more than 25 of these fully dedicated to Ayurveda. Barberyn Ayurveda Resorts are the founders of the first Ayurveda resort ever, in 1984, and thus pioneers of Ayurvedic tourism in Sri Lanka.

Barberyn Reef has 75 rooms which are furnished with hand crafted wood made on site by our own team of carpenters. Rooms have mosquito nets, attached toilets with showers or bath tubs, natural ventilation as well as electric fans and a terrace or balcony.

Only a few of the rooms are air conditioned, as most guests prefer natural ventilation – which is recommended during Ayurveda treatment.

Garden Rooms and Beach Front Rooms are clusters of rooms situated in several blocks – some are on stilts, others are located on two levels (ground floor rooms and first floor rooms).

Each room is unique with its own character and identity depending on the location and the furnishing. Rooms are allocated subject to availability.

### FACILITIES & SURROUNDS

Barberyn Reef Ayurveda Resort is set on a long strip of beach, with a reef running the length of the resort, forming a natural swimming lagoon. Sri Lanka’s well known landscape artist, Laki Senanayake, is doing the landscaping at the resort. The resort has a casual and serene ambience.

A journalist writing for ‘The Nation’ Newspaper in Thailand remarked: “Lulled by the rhythmic pounding of the Indian Ocean nearby, relaxed by the kneading of daily oil massages, long-staying guests eventually emulate an aura of well-being, signaled by slower speech and a softer demeanor. No wonder that many of the guests end up rescheduling flights and extending their stays.”

### Facilities include the following:

- Ayurveda health centre
- Sea view dining room serving breakfast, lunch and dinner
- Reception
- Swimming pool adjacent to the ocean
- Conference facility
- The arts and crafts shop
- Jewelry shop
- Beauty Salon

- Reading room
- Shrine room
- Food demonstrations
- Ayurveda lectures
- Cultural evenings
- WiFi Internet Service
- Laundry
- Tailor
- Foreign currency exchange

## **THE DINING ROOM**

The dining room reflects the mood of the resort. Sri Lankan tradition requires the host to share the food of the house with the guests. The special management structure of the resort is most evident in the dining room, where the waiters work smoothly, without instruction from supervisors. The best of fresh ingredients and leaf vegetables from the resort’s gardens go into the preparation of the meals, and the service comes with quiet efficiency

#### More information

Guests dine at “their” table each day in the large and airy dining room. It is full of laughter and chatter during meal times, a place where friendships are quickly formed. Single guests often join others – or maintain their solitude, just as they wish.

The dining room spills out onto the terrace for outdoor dining. A wide range of food is served for breakfast and at the lunch buffet. Dinner is a set vegetarian meal. Kitchen and dining room work closely together to see that the guests get the food that the doctors prescribe. Each table has an individual card with directions.

The waiters will gently remind you what Ayurvedic food you should – and should not – eat. An Ayurveda physician is on hand at meal times and can advise you which specific vegetables, herbs and spices to select – and which to avoid, according to the treatment prescribed by the consulting physician.

Breakfast and lunch are buffet-style. Dinner is a set meal, served at the table. Guests also get herbal drinks and soups specially prescribed by the physicians. The menu takes account of the dietary needs of all guests. Those on a “controlled diet” are asked to avoid certain dishes. All guests eagerly await the meals at Barberyn Reef Ayurveda resort as they quickly learn the advantage of Ayurveda food: healthy food can also be tasty food. Fresh vegetables and fruits are a special treat, including the fruit service at breakfast.

Sri Lankan delicacies such as the well known “hoppers” are served for Sri Lankan Night each week.

Morning and afternoon tea and fruit juices are served at the dining room or poolside.

Sri Lankan traditional music is played several times a week at dinner time.

### The Sunshine Restaurant

The little beach restaurant serves tea, light meals and fruit juices. It is a magical place to enjoy the aroma of fresh Sri Lankan tea, or enjoy a relaxing drink as the sun goes down over the horizon.

Barberyn Reef Ayurveda Resort is located on Sri Lanka’s south-west coast, 85km south from Colombo International Airport.

A long sea-front sheltered by a natural reef runs the length of the resort and forms a natural swimming lagoon. Sand stretches for miles along the shore.

## EXCURSIONS / Day Trips   IN AND AROUND BERUWALA

Beruwala, the location of Barberyn Reef Ayurveda Resort, lies 58 km south of Colombo. It is a popular holiday destination. A large number of hotels is located in what is known as the “golden mile” of beach.

The town adjacent to Beruwala provides facilities tourists may need, such as a post office, bank, a tourist office, a government handicraft shop, a teashop and a few restaurants. It also offers a “bazaar” (a place where locals shop) and an open “wet market” where one can buy fruit or vegetables.

#### More information

Barberyn arranges short excursions to places of interests in the vicinity on most afternoons during the week. **These excursions are free of charge to resident guests.**

- **The Galapota Temple**, a few kilometers inland, on the south bank of the river, is said to date from the 12th Century.
- **Warakagoda Temple**, a small cave temple where you see tea and rubber plantations and village hamlets en route. The tour also includes a visit to a nearby “tourist village” where you can see traditional crafts being produced.
- **Brief Garden**, ten kilometers inland from Bentota. It used to be the home of Bevis Bawa, older brother of renowned Sri Lankan architect Geoffrey Bawa. His house is the highlight of the tour:the artwork on display is eclectic, including a piece from one-time house guest Donald Friend. Entry is Rs.1,000. The garden is open from 8am to 5pm daily.
- **Gangatilaka Vihara**: South of the Kalu Gaga Bridge on the main road. It is a hollow dagoba (Buddhist Shrine) with an interestingly painted interior.
- **The Kechimalai Mosque** is said to be built on the site of the landing of the first Arabic merchants and is the focus for a major festival at the end of Ramadan.
- The **Turtle Sanctuary** at Induruwa
- **River cruises**

### Galle

The port of Galle, thought by some to be the Biblical city of Tarshish, splendidly illustrates the solidity of the Dutch presence in Sri Lanka. The 36-hectare (89 acre) Dutch Fort, built in 1663, has withstood the ravages of time. Its massive ramparts surround the promontory that forms the older part of Galle, and shelters within its walls sturdy Dutch houses, museums and churches. This area has a quiet, relaxed atmosphere that seems almost detached from the flow of history. On the way stop at the Ambalangoda mask making factory. Entry Rs. 300.

### Wet market

Visit the wet market in a three-wheeler, where you can see people buying vegetables, fruits and daily ware. Browse around and get a feel for the locality and its people.

### Further away:

The resort also arranges visits to places of interest in the south of Sri Lanka – at a reasonable price.

ILLNESSES TREATED AT BARBERYN: RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS \| Barberyn Ayurveda Resorts

# Illnesses treated at Barberyn: Rheumatoid Arthritis

### Name of medical problem: Rheumatoid Arthritis   Ayurveda name: Gambheera Vatha Raktha

**Type of illness:** Rheumatoid Arthritis is a disease affecting primarily the joints of the hand and feet, which become swollen and painful. If not treated in its early stages, it may result in deformity and difficulty in movement.

Cause of illness:

Ayurveda states that dietary factors, problems with digestion, alcohol abuse, mental stress, and obesity are some of the causes of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Dietary factors include excessive use of sour, salty, pungent tasting food, spicy food such as chili, and oily food. Due to these causative factors,vatha dosha and pitha dosha aggravate and cause impurities in the blood.

The toxic substances, which are absorbed in the blood, collect in hand, leg and finger joints, due to gravity. In the beginning, joints get swollen, painful and stiff. This is very prominent with the little joints in hands, legs and fingers. Redness of skin can be seen on the joint. Sometimes itching and burning sensation is experienced, and perspiration may increase or decrease.

If not treated immediately, the muscles, ligaments, synovial membrane of the joint remain swollen, and joints become extremely painful. In the next stage, the cartilage of the joint can get damaged and calcium deposition can take place. This leads to deformity of the joint. The disease can then spread to other joints.

### Specific symptoms:

- In the beginning, the disease affects the small joints in fingers.
- Pain in joints. Pain is at its worst on awakening in the morning and may decrease with movement.
- Stiffness of muscles around the joints of the finger, so that the joints tend to curve. At the beginning, stiffness is stronger in the morning and can be present for several hours.
- Joint swelling
- Fatigue and general malaise, increased or decreased perspiration.
- Later stages – joint deformity, difficulty in moving the joints, muscle wasting can be seen around the joint.
- Disease then spreads towards the wrist joints, ankle joints, elbow joints, knee joints, shoulders, hip and spine.

Ayurveda treatment of rheumatoid arthritis consists of a combination of internal and external applications of Ayurveda medicine.

### Internal treatment:

- **Thripala kawatha:** is a decoction, which contains Aralu (Terminalia chebula), Bulu (Terminalia belirica), and Nelli (Phyllauthus embelica). This is given orally, two tablespoons, three times a day. The preparation has a mild laxative action and purifies the body.
- **Chandraprabha vati:** Herbal pills called Chandraprabha vati, which contains many herbs and guggulu. The dosage is two tablets, twice a day. The pills have diuretic action and purify the body.
- **Manibadra powder** is an orally taken herbal powder, which has blood purifying action. Dosage is one teaspoon, twice daily.
- **Special freshly made herbal decoctions:** The decoction contains Dummalla (Trichosanthes cucumerina), Katukarosana (Picrorrliza kurrooa), Asparagus roots (Asparagus racemosus), etc. with Eranda oil (oil obtained from seeds of the ricinus communis plant).
After 7 days, it is changed into another decoction. These decoctions have mild laxative action, which purifies the impure blood and balances the aggravated Pitha dosha.
- **Verechana karma** (Purgation therapy) is also recommended for rheumatoid arthritis. Oral medicines are administered to induce purgation. It purifies the body and balances the pitha dosha.

### External treatment:

Following treatments are also given depending on the patient’s condition.

- **Vasthi Karma or medicated enema treatment** – is also used when the pain is more prominent. Depending on the stage of the disease, medicated oils or decoctions are administrated.
- **Pinda oil:** medicated oil, namely Pinda oil, is gently massaged over the affected joints. This oil is prepared with the base of sesame oil, bees wax, welmadata (Rubia cordifolia) et.al. It reduces localized pain and burning sensation and balances the Vatha and Pitha dosha.
- **Special herbal pastes** are also applied to the inflamed and affected joints. This special paste contains red sandle wood, sesame seeds, seeds of the ricinus communis (Eranda seeds) and milk. This is very good for reducing inflammation and pain.

**Prospects of cure:** Disease can be cured in the early stages. When there is any muscle wasting or when joint deformities have taken place already, it is very difficult to cure. Ayurveda medicine and therapies can however, bring about a reduction in symptoms and pain.

## Barberyn Webinar Video: Cooking Demonstration

### Manick – How to Cook Healthy & Tasty Food

- We have come to this point of culinary development from a diet of mainly raw leaves.
- In the early times we adopted a simple style of cooking which was boiling all the ingredients together and this still remains with the Soup which is also a basic dish in the west.
- Bringing the food to a boiling point and simmering on low heat is the basis of Sri Lanka cuisine and the curry, as with the soup. Coconut milk and the spices add flavor and nutrition to the Curry.
- Rice also follows this same method. People are moving away from this slow-cooking methods
- Because of the fast pace of life and we are fortunate that the method still prevails and there is a greater awareness in preserving the value and nourishment of the ingredients.

## Webinar Video: Practice Yoga Asana with Amesh

At Barberyn Beach Ayurveda Resort we conduct daily yoga classes in the morning and evening for beginners and intermediate students. Our yoga teachers are qualified from the Sivananda School of Hatha Yoga.

Barberyn Yoga class is designed to complement the Ayurveda treatments. We mainly focus on synchronizing the breathing and yoga posture. For experienced yogis, they can hold the Yoga Asana for a longer period as long as they’re comfortable. Our teachers emphasize on proper relaxation, at the beginning, end and in between yoga postures to improve mental relaxation, reduce stress, prevent formation of lactic acid and prevent fatigue after class. Our guests who practice daily yoga feel energized, more focused and do not feel tired after the class. Practicing daily yoga asana and pranayama helps Ayurveda medicine to become more effective in treating certain conditions such as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Constipation, Stress, Insomnia and it makes you happy.

#### **Doctors Script:**

Ayubowan!

I am Dr. Haresha, a researcher from Barberyn Ayurveda Resorts and Institute of Ayurveda and Alternative Medicine. In the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak, Dr. Chamal and I researched Covid-19 with the Ayurvedic medical system.

Five thousand years ago, our great sages had spoken about such infectious diseases as _Janapadodwansa_ diseases. Sage Charaka says this is mainly due to moving away from a healthy state. My colleague Dr. Pushpa has already explained about a healthy person described in Ayurveda.

We all know that prevention is better than cure while there is no medicine for Covid-19 as of now, we have found several important facts regarding the current outbreak through our research. Some of them are proper & nutrient food, a healthy lifestyle, a pleasant mind, and good immunity. Among them, enhancing the body’s natural defense system (Immunity) plays a vital role in maintaining optimum health.

## Webinar Video: Practice Yoga Asana with Amesh

At Barberyn Beach Ayurveda Resort we conduct daily yoga classes in the morning and evening for beginners and intermediate students. Our yoga teachers are qualified from the Sivananda School of Hatha Yoga.

Barberyn Yoga class is designed to complement the Ayurveda treatments. We mainly focus on synchronizing the breathing and yoga posture. For experienced yogis, they can hold the Yoga Asana for a longer period as long as they’re comfortable. Our teachers emphasize on proper relaxation, at the beginning, end and in between yoga postures to improve mental relaxation, reduce stress, prevent formation of lactic acid and prevent fatigue after class. Our guests who practice daily yoga feel energized, more focused and do not feel tired after the class. Practicing daily yoga asana and pranayama helps Ayurveda medicine to become more effective in treating certain conditions such as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Constipation, Stress, Insomnia and it makes you happy.

” Health is Wealth , Peace of Mind is Happiness, Yoga shows the way! ” Swami Vishnu-devananda

As the suburban sprawl extends to the village, old crafts that rely on patient work by hand give way to modern industry and employment in the factory.

In an effort to revive some of the village crafts and provide a sales point for the products, the “Oriental Collection” draws together the work of artists and craftspeople from several countries in this region.

Many of the products are made using skills and designs handed down from generation to generation – beautiful testaments to the region’s rich culture and history.

From naturally dyed, hand woven silks, to colourful, intricate embroideries, artifacts of wood, reed and handcrafted silver – the “Oriental Collection” is designed to let you take a little treasure back home – at a fair price.

### Manick – How to Cook Healthy & Tasty Food

- We have come to this point of culinary development from a diet of mainly raw leaves.
- In the early times we adopted a simple style of cooking which was boiling all the ingredients together and this still remains with the Soup which is also a basic dish in the west.
- Bringing the food to a boiling point and simmering on low heat is the basis of Sri Lanka cuisine and the curry, as with the soup. Coconut milk and the spices add flavor and nutrition to the Curry.
- Rice also follows this same method. People are moving away from this slow-cooking methods
- Because of the fast pace of life and we are fortunate that the method still prevails and there is a greater awareness in preserving the value and nourishment of the ingredients.

ILLNESSES TREATED AT BARBERYN: PARKINSON’S DISEASE \| Barberyn Ayurveda Resorts

# Illnesses treated at Barberyn: Parkinson’s disease

### **Name of medical problem:** Parkinsonism/ Parkinson’s disease  **Ayurveda name:** Kampa Vatha

**Symptoms**: According to the principles of Ayurveda, Parkinson’s disease develops because of aggravation of Vata Dosha in the nerves in the brain. Aggravated Vata Dosha can dry up the nerves with adverse affects. The disease usually develops during middle age or old age. According to western medical views, the loss of dopamine – the nerve transmitter – is one of the main causes of the disease.

- Patient may develop tremors (shaking) of hands or fingers. This is present before starting work (movements of fingers like pill rolling). Sometimes this can be seen even in the rest of the body. But once the patient starts to do something, the tremors will stop.
- Patient feels stiffness (rigidity) present in muscles.
- When walking, patient cannot turn at once

## Ayurveda Treatments:

Ayurveda treatment of Parkinson consists of a combination of internal and external applications of Ayurvedic medicine.

### Internal treatment:

- **Usually a set of decoctions** (herbal medicinal drinks) is given. At the beginning, decoction should contain ingredients to achieve a balance of Vata Dosha; later the decoctions should have nutritious or rejuvenating value. The decoctions contain masha (Undu) – Phaselolusradiatus, Babila – Sidacordifolia etc. and are very effective.
- **Dasamula Arishta**, which contains several ingredients, including herbs and roots such as Aswenna, Polpala, Elabatu, Katuwelbatu, Hinnerenchi, Beli, Midi, Thotia, Palol, Et demata and other herbs, is also given orally to balance the Vata Dosha and as a tonic.
- **Ashwaganda Choorana** – orally taken herbal powder. Dosage: one teaspoon, twice a day with milk. It contains a medicinal plant named Ashwaganda-With aniasomnifera, which has a mainly rejuvenating property and acts as a nerve tonic.

### External treatment:

Following treatments are also given depending on the patient’s condition.

- **Shiro Abhyanga and Shareera Abhyanga** (special head and body oil application)
- **Shiro Dara Treatment** (special head oil treatment)
- **Pinda Sweda Treatment** (Mild oil massage is administered to the patient with the help of special milk rice medicinal bundles made of cheesecloth.
- **Shiro Vasti treatment** (Keeping oil over the head with the help of special cap)
- **Nasya karma** (drops inhaled through the nose)
- **Rasayana karma** (Rejuvenation)

**Prospects of cure:** Depends on the severity and complications of the disease. If in early stages, disease can be retarded, and symptoms can be controlled.

Minimum period of treatment in order to see improvements should be more than four weeks.

Barberyn celebrates its commitment to sustainable development and the protection of Sri Lanka medicinal plant heritage

# Barberyn celebrates its commitment to sustainable development and the protection of Sri Lanka medicinal plant heritage

**Exhibition On Ayurveda And Sustainable Tourism.**

The beautiful exhibition demonstrates the linkages between Ayurveda, Tourism and Sustainability. Barberyn’s vision of Human Development goes beyond the three pillars of sustainable development articulated by the International community and encompasses the sanctity of life, human consciousness and inner peace.

According to the ancient wisdom of Ayurveda, human beings and the universe are made up of the same five elements or Pancha Maha Bootha: Apo (water), Thejo (fire), Vayo (air), Pruthuvi (earth), and Akasha (space/ether). These common factors create a harmony between human beings, the fauna and flora and the universe. Just as the sun and moons’ gravitational forces affect the tides in the sea, these forces also shape temperaments of living beings. The Ayurveda medicine incorporates the knowledge of such external forces when treating each individual. The Tri Dosha –Vatha, Pitha and Kapha – keep the balance in the body; consciousness and truth keep the integrity of the mind and the heart. When these elements are in a state of equilibrium, human development resonates harmoniously.

This ancient wisdom is “sustainable” for it is a paradigm that is indigenous to us, passed down from one generation to another. So the Barberyn philosophy pre-dates new theories of sustainability. It has evolved and matured over three generations and what has been learnt from the Founders is passed on to the Barberyn family, the children, the staff, the guests and the community and, as we develop each other, we come naturally to sustainable tourism.

YOGA IS A POWERFUL COMPLEMENT TO AYURVEDIC TREATMENTS \| Barberyn Ayurveda Resorts

# YOGA AT BARBERYN AYURVEDA RESORTS

# YOGA AT BARBERYN AYURVEDA RESORTS

## **Yoga is a powerful complement to Ayurvedic treatments**

Yoga has been recognized and practiced for thousands of years in South Asia as a powerful complement to Ayurvedic medicine and healing.

Ayurveda and Yoga come from the same philosophical matrix. They examine the body/mind concept from the perspective of maintenance of health and treatment of diseases.

Meditation

Yogic postures and breathing techniques have long been known for their health benefits. The 15th century “Manual on Yoga Practice”, the “Hatha Yoga Pradipika” states that “sturdiness, absence of disease and lightness” will be the result of the practice of postures (asana). Some of the Asanas do activate the endocrine system, which consists of ductless glands. This endocrine system is responsible for keeping all the vital organs healthy and functioning properly, and aims at the perfection of the body.

Apart from the curative value, Yoga brings tranquility and stillness into our lives. The two aspects of Yoga thus provide a powerful tool for coping with the physical and mental stress of modern day living.

### Yoga

Yoga practiced at Barberyn is mainly traditional Hatha Yoga (postures) with Pranayama (breathing). It is designed to awaken the Kundalini (third eye). This form of Yoga helps to elongate the spine. If one can keep the spine supple, it helps delay the aging process. “You are as old as your spine”.

Yoga is practiced in the morning and evening. We also organize Yoga classes for beginners and special yoga sessions from time to time. The physicians encourage guests to join at least one session every day. The class held on the roof top with a view of the ocean starts with the “Sun Salutation” and moves on to breathing exercises (Pranayama).The teacher demonstrates up to 12 different Asanas that will be practiced to keep the spine supple.

We also organize Yoga classes for beginners and special Ashtanga Yoga classes so our guests can enjoy different postures and routines. The yoga teachers at Barberyn will adapt their daily routine and postures according to the guests attending the class, so that they can get the maximum benefit.

Sunday Webinar Program for August

## Sunday Webinar Program for August

Ayubowan!

We are happy to let you know that we will continue the **Barberyn webinars** in the month of **August**.

The webinars will continue each **Sunday at 11:00 AM European Summer Time/ 10:00 AM UK** – click here to join

The lineup of webinars in August is as follows:

Sunday 2 August : **Mindfulness practice** with Geetha at Barberyn Reef

Sunday 9 August : **Ayurveda and Forest Medicine** with Dr Pushpa

Sunday 16 August : **Harmony in body and mind**: Yoga with Amesh

Sunday 23 August : **Cooking** with Manick and the Barberyn Chefs

Sunday 30 August : **Everything begins in the Forest** – New Dimensions in

well-being, at Diyabubula, Barberyns Jungle and Art Hideaway.

The first webinar for August will be this **Sunday at 11:00 AM European Summer Time/ 10:00 AM UK** about mindfulness practice. The practice of **Mindfulness** is known to help in resolving common human problems such as stress, anxiety and depression. and help in personality development. These are however fringe benefits in the practice. Mindfulness is, in fact, a spiritual journey that focuses on the deep interconnection between the body and the mind. Mindfulness leads to awareness and this leads to insight – a profound level of understanding that is beyond intellect and can only be known through experience.

Geetha will lead the first webinar and will explain this philosophy in a simple and practical way.

We look forward to practice with you.

## Webinar Video: Ayurveda Cooking Demonstration

The Ayurveda medicine that we drink (Decoctions, powders and pills and sweet elixirs) are plant-based. Individually and in combination these plants have unique properties that help in preventing and curing disease. Ayurveda food is also plant-based. And each of these plants and their combinations have medicinal values. This is why we hear from the physicians that “we are what we eat” or more precisely “we are what we digest” When the food is fresh, cooked with compatible ingredients and prepared in accordance with the principles of Ayurveda, food becomes medicine. Medicine becomes food and nourishment.

In this webinar, we share with you some of the dishes you have come to love at Barberyn Kurakkan Roti, Lunumiris, and rice flour pudding. They are easy to make, nourishing, wholesome and tasty. Try making them and you will taste your reward.

### Manick – How to Cook Healthy & Tasty Food

- We have come to this point of culinary development from a diet of mainly raw leaves.
- In the early times we adopted a simple style of cooking which was boiling all the ingredients together and this still remains with the Soup which is also a basic dish in the west.
- Bringing the food to a boiling point and simmering on low heat is the basis of Sri Lanka cuisine and the curry, as with the soup. Coconut milk and the spices add flavor and nutrition to the Curry.
- Rice also follows this same method. People are moving away from this slow-cooking methods
- Because of the fast pace of life and we are fortunate that the method still prevails and there is a greater awareness in preserving the value and nourishment of the ingredients.

#### **Doctors Script:**

Ayubowan!

I am Dr. Haresha, a researcher from Barberyn Ayurveda Resorts and Institute of Ayurveda and Alternative Medicine. In the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak, Dr. Chamal and I researched Covid-19 with the Ayurvedic medical system.

Five thousand years ago, our great sages had spoken about such infectious diseases as _Janapadodwansa_ diseases. Sage Charaka says this is mainly due to moving away from a healthy state. My colleague Dr. Pushpa has already explained about a healthy person described in Ayurveda.

We all know that prevention is better than cure while there is no medicine for Covid-19 as of now, we have found several important facts regarding the current outbreak through our research. Some of them are proper & nutrient food, a healthy lifestyle, a pleasant mind, and good immunity. Among them, enhancing the body’s natural defense system (Immunity) plays a vital role in maintaining optimum health.

Firstly, wash and soak the green gram about 04 to 05 hours. If you wish to germinate the green gram you can wash and soak the green gram overnight and then remove the water and place a cotton cloth on a plate and spread the wet gram and keep to germinate for 24 hrs.

Secondly, boil the green gram in the light coconut milk until the gram is lightly boiled and add all the other ingredients and continue to boil until soft to the touch and the liquid has evaporated. Add the tick coconut milk and salt to taste, and let it cook for another 5 minutes on a low fire, stirring from time to time until the curry has thickened.

# Barberyn Webinar Video: Daily Routine in Ayurveda

### **Learn the Daily routine in Ayurveda with the Barberyn Physicians** at the Home of Barberyn’s Institute of Ayurveda and Alternative Medicine.

The beautifully restored 100-year-old house is the backdrop where the Physicians are explaining the routine – the _**Daily Routine**_, _**Seasonal Routine**_ and the _**Code of Conduct**_ which enables us to maintain a healthy way of life.

They will also demonstrate an Ayurveda oil application that you can practice on your self or your loved ones.

#### **Doctors Script:**

Ayubowan!

I am Dr. Haresha, a researcher from Barberyn Ayurveda Resorts and Institute of Ayurveda and Alternative Medicine. In the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak, Dr. Chamal and I researched Covid-19 with the Ayurvedic medical system.

Five thousand years ago, our great sages had spoken about such infectious diseases as _Janapadodwansa_ diseases. Sage Charaka says this is mainly due to moving away from a healthy state. My colleague Dr. Pushpa has already explained about a healthy person described in Ayurveda.

We all know that prevention is better than cure while there is no medicine for Covid-19 as of now, we have found several important facts regarding the current outbreak through our research. Some of them are proper & nutrient food, a healthy lifestyle, a pleasant mind, and good immunity. Among them, enhancing the body’s natural defense system (Immunity) plays a vital role in maintaining optimum health.

We are pleased to inform you that we have prepared some medicines that are mentioned in our authentic Ayurvedic texts which enhance immunity. One such preparation is _chavana-prashavaleha_. It is a sweet, energizing paste we made at this Institute. We will give it to you once you come here meanwhile we hope you remember the coriander and ginger tea which we suggested in our first mail-out, that is also an immune booster.

Advancement in society or its scientific progress leads to altered lifestyle which has many implications on human health and may lead to many disorders such as Diabetes mellitus, Hypertension, Dyslipidemia, Ischemic heart disease and obesity. Those diseases are called lifestyle disorders or diseases of civilization. Lifestyle diseases are different from other diseases because they are potentially preventable and can be lowered with changes in the diet, lifestyle disorders or diseases of civilization. Lifestyle diseases are different from other diseases because they are potentially avoidable and can be reduced with changes in diet, lifestyle changes and environment.

As I mentioned before a good lifestyle helps in enhancing our immunity.

Let’s think about what is a good lifestyle?

Ayurveda talks about the ideal routine for our life. There are 03 aspects.

1. **Dina charya (daily regimen)**
2. **Ritu charya (seasonal regimen)**
3. **Sadvritta (codes and conducts)**

Today I will deal with the Dina charya or daily routine.

**Dina chariya starts with waking up early morning before sunrise.** Early morning before sunrise is called Brahma muhurta which means the hours of gods. I know this could be difficult for some of you. But try to wake up as early as possible.

Once you get up early in the morning you have to drink some lukewarm water. Then you may ask how much water should I take? The water that you can hold in both the hands which makes a concavity.

**The next point is bowel evacuation.**

After waking up you will feel the urge for urination and bowel evacuation then you will go to the toilet. Do not delay and always do not force to evacuate the bowel.

If you don’t feel the urge to evacuate the bowel in the morning or if you are constipated you should take healthy food specially enriched with high fibre content. You should examine your diet if you are continuously constipated.

If constipation persists you can take some Ayurveda pills or powders like Triphala powder or triphala tablets.

It is important to eliminate the stools in your bowels because the stools filled in bowels may develop toxins that can lead to Gas bloating, Flatulence, acid reflux and several other diseases as well.

The second point is expressing gratitude and meditation. Once you wake up, you can spend even a few minutes expressing your gratitude to the universe and your life through chanting or through meditation. Early morning is a good time to meditate.

You can meditate for at least 5 minutes and feel the surroundings and nature. Meditation after waking up helps you to get positive energy and make your day more constructive, joyful and energy fulfilling. It also prevents all stress disorders, depression and anxiety in your life. This will help you to have a better sleep too.

**Next is the cleaning of the tongue and teeth.** In Ayurveda it is called dantha davana and jihva nirlekhana.

Ayurveda recommends the use of plant twig from particular medicinal plants such as Salvadora and special herbal powder. We have already made the herbal powder and now we start to make the herbal brushes from the Salvadora plant at our Institute.

We recommend using a silver tongue scraper for cleaning the tongue.

You can gently scrape the tongue. Scraping of the tongue in the correct manner brings valuable results such as prevention of frequent mouth ulcers, hyperacidity, peptic ulcers, gastritis and increase of the secretions of digestive enzymes.

**Next point is oil pulling.** In Ayurveda it is called _gandusha._

During oil pulling, take a small mouthful of such oil and hold it in your mouth without any gargling or movements. Virgin coconut oil is ideal unless sesame oil can be taken as an option.

You have to hold the oil in your mouth for about 2 minutes then throw it out.

**The next thing to do is oil application.** In Ayurveda it is called Abhyanga.

We can apply oil on our head and body. Oil application on the head brings many benefits such as;

- Improve the eyesight
- Prevent insomnia (lack of sleep)
- Improve the memory and hair growth
- Reduce the stress, anxiety and depression
- Enhance the general well being

Body oil application is also beneficial as it relieves the body pains, tiredness, debility and disabilities along with aging and improves the blood circulation.

Oil application plays a main role during Ayurveda treatments too.

**The next point is exercise**. This is referred to in Ayurveda as Vyayama.

Your body is not made for a sedentary lifestyle. Due to the current scenario most people are suffering from lifestyle disorders such as IHD DM HTN HL. Exercise or yoga asana for at least 30 minutes a day can make a big difference in your health.

**Next is taking a bath**. In Ayurveda; the bathing is called as Snana.

The bath apart from cleaning a body it improves your appetite, vigor, strength and life span. Hot water should not be poured on the head. But you can use lukewarm water for it. Warm water is suitable for the lower body.

There are 03 vital points in our body that we should pay attention to.

1. Crown of the head
2. Heart
3. Lower abdomen

These areas of the body should always be protected.

That concludes my part on Ayurveda daily routines, I will hand you over to Mrs. Thilaka to demonstrate the _shiro-abhyanga,_ that is head oil application. It is something you can learn to do yourself.

Our experience was very nice. We enjoyed the resort scenery, the treatment and the kindness of the employees.

The doctors are very professional and knowledgeable. I have one remark, if possible, to work more on the noise everywhere, the cleanliness of the rooms, the public areas and the cleanliness of the house keeping personal. They need to be careful about their smell.

Thank you,

Note – The staff are very friendly and welcoming.

This was my 8th time with Barberyn Spa Resorts. Each experience was delightful. Restful and rejuvenating and each was better than the last. This time at Waves has been magical and memorable. Our whole group from Pakistan was so very delighted and went away with the firm resolve to come back again with many more friends!

Keep Going!

Room 436 – 04.08.24

The greenery, the gardens, the flowers, the beautifully appointed and yet simple rooms. Early morning yoga, the pool at sunset watching the red ball of sun sinking behind the palm trees, 6 am yoga in the Garden Pavilion – such beauty.  Balsam for the soul. But oh-so-hot in the room! The treatments depended on the therapists. My first and last days massage were irritating soft, but in between they were wonderful. Choose your therapists well!

Where do I start? Is it the punctual and friendly driver who picked me up, completely exhausted at Colombo airport? Or the health centre professionals who with every day and treatment show their expertise coupled with love and happiness? Each employee here at Barberyn has played a special role in making my first (& hopefully not the last!) Ayurveda retreat so memorable. May health continue to be strong thanks to all of you.

THANK YOU SO MUCH

**How does one describe their time at Barberyn?** Is it magical from the smiling staff, the incredible treatments (I don’t know how it works but it does!). The beauty of the gardens and the beach, the delicious food and the love and care with which it is prepared and presented. For all this, and for feeling part of this family here I can never thank you enough!

This place is an amazing source of balance, full of kindness, generosity and heartfelt warmth. Since we have a very strong New Moon Eclipse together it seems to boost the life changing opportunities in this resort, working for those who are open for it. I will for sure come back regularly to recover from the challenges of life outside the as often as I feel it could be helpful. Thanks to all the staff, the brilliant doctor, to all the experts in the health centre and to the kitchen staff! The food alone could be enough to get back into balance. You will see me again.

Dear Barberyn Team (all of you)

This is my first time here and I am more than happy to do this very special kind of vacation! People are very very friendly, helpful and warm hearted, the treatments are as great as the Ayurvedic food is and I could relax completely.

A special thanks to Dulijie, Manoji and Milani for the great job, a great “bravo” for the whole kitchen staff and as well as thank you so much Kusali from the tailor shop for having worked so fast, beautiful and well.

As a travel journalist I have visited many places in the whole world, but this one here is unique – also thanks to the “spirit” of the management which is more than human and grateful. I will try to get back here!

What an amazing place full of wonderful people – both people who work here and the guests. I was not sure what to expect from my visit; to be honest I was a little apprehensive about the whole Ayurveda experience and also undertaking it by myself. But the whole 2 weeks have been a real adventure and a pleasure. I found myself quickly settling into the rhythm & the routines of the place – not that I ever got used to the early morning potion. More to my liking was the tea & cookies treat in the afternoon at the Sunshine restaurant. A place to catch up with all the new friends I have made.

Thank you to all the Barberyn staff who made my stay so perfect

What can I say I am a man who likes to hug and I would like to hug all of the people who work at or for the Barberyn Reef Ayurveda Resort. You have created an oasis of relief from this crazy world, a place to heal. A place to refresh and a place from which one can leave like a butterfly from a cocoon.

Thank you, Thank you

Thank you for the wonderful stay at Barberyn. I know only a little about Ayurveda and was looking forward to the experience here.

To my surprise the “treatment” involved so many special medicines, which are mostly made at Barberyn according to the traditional technologies, massage and oil treatments, food, yoga, very much kindness and warm comfortable climate.

Staff were wonderful from beginning to the end. Food was unbelievably good and I managed to reduce 2kgs on a mostly vegetarian diet while experiencing new tastes and never been bothered by hunger cravings. The weight I lost was from the belly, which is a special desire of post-menopausal women.

There have been other signs of improved health, sleep with dreams, improved digestion, better focus and short-term memory. Small changes but very significant for me, that I suspect will continue for the following year.

I want to appreciate the Barberyn family for many years developing this unique facility which is I am sure an asset to the local people as well as to the guests who benefit. There must have been some difficult time earlier on.

I really enjoyed been able to learn about Ayurveda from tour of the medicine area, the cooking demonstration and the lecture. Also the doctors in the dining area who were always encouraging and ready to teach about the properties of different food.

The presence of the ocean nearby. The lily pad pond frogs and lotuses.

Again, thank you to all. We will return

I wasn’t sure that I’d like Barberyn Reef as much as the smaller Ayurveda places I stayed in India, but I did. It’s a beautiful resort in lovely setting and it was great to be able to snorkel in the nearby sea and use a pool. I found the staff friendly and helpful and prepared to go the extra mile to ensure that I had a really restful and relaxing stay. The kitchen and restaurant staff ensured that I got Sri Lankan meals rather than the western food I wished to escape from. The Ayurveda was particularly impressive , with hand prepared medicine , extremely good doctors and excellent caring therapists(especially the two I got to know best, Silva and Sagarika) \* and I was also impressed  by the yoga and meditation teachers Anoja and her team who gave classes beneficial to both mind and body. I learnt much to take home to keep me sane, cheery and fit despite my pressurised Western lifestyle. I hope to return before long, family, financial and work issues notwithstanding.

\\* A special mention should go to the extremely helpful and efficient admin staff at the Health Centre.

It is a rare experience to find peace, gentleness and kindness in so many different forms. From the wonderful ever attentive boys in the Dining room, doctors watching over at all times to the incredible nurturing and the expert healing staff. Such a rare to find in this day and age. To my dear room cleaners who are so much more than that, always attending to every need and watching over the many details especially during treatments.

I feel completely rejuvenated and regenerated and will come again.

Having always been “the given” over many years it has been such a treat and joy to receive and to be spoilt. I thank each and every one of you who have made it all possible.

You have created a sanctuary which tends to the body, mind, soul a rare find in this day and age so deep gratitude for everyone.

Dear Barberyn Family & Friends,

In the crazy world that we live in I feel I found my place of Paradise. It is such a pleasure to see so many smiling faces workers and visitors alike. The world looks so much better now that I can see some hope through the eyes of the people I have met while being here. Everything takes place with so much love and care from those who clean the surrounding gardens, the security men, the housekeeping, the front desk, the doctors and all the staff at the health centre and of course a big big thank you to the chef who prepares fabulous food and all his kitchen staff which is later served by the wonderful caring waiters.

A big thank you to the Dietician Doctor who helped me on a daily basis to choose the right food and the whole staff who were always there!

Shalom

Peace and lots of Love

Dear Barberyn Family,

Two weeks I stayed here, and I enjoyed every second. The kindness of all people here, the silent service and the wonderful food!

I felt the spirit of Ayurveda, Yoga and Meditation in every action. Treatments, food coaching, housekeeping, pool service, security – thank you to you all and big compliments.

Thank you for this place where values like trust, friendship, hospitality and peace matter of course.

Please stay forward leading this house in this philosophy and tradition.

As the sun sets on one of the most amazing holidays, I have ever had, I would like to say “Thank You!”. The staff, my beach room #59, the food, the doctors, the absolute feeling of Blizz!.

I can’t thank you all enough. As I write a chipmunk sits eating piece of apple by my knee, I wave at the kind gentlemen, who let me feed the fish in morning with him. I had absolutely no idea what Ayurveda was about, but these past weeks have taught me that its more than medicine. Its light, love, laughter, sharing, peace, and wholeness.

Thank you for looking after me so amazingly, thank you for all working tirelessly and thank you for sharing your peace of paradise with me.

I Love Barberyn and will be back with friends and family.

All my Love

We came not expecting what we received and are most pleased to have come. The only regret is having only stayed for 1 week instead of the recommended 2-3 weeks. Nevertheless, it has opened the door to a longer stay next time we planned to come.

Some of the pleasantries: –

1. Courteous and helpful staff much impressed
2. Calm and wonderful surroundings
3. Great medical treatments from doctors who genuinely care for the patients
4. Great variety of vegetable dishes never experienced before. No pretence of being vegetarian dishes or vegetables
5. Service in massaging, tea bath, paste treatments all given with a warm and gentle approach
6. Staff all seem dedicated, gardeners as well

We are touched by Sri Lankans and their service

Thank you Barberyn I didn’t so much plan in advance to come here, but I was not so well 2 weeks ago and needed to take some time away form London. I was looking for a wellness centre in Sri Lanka and could tell from the chatter online that there was something special about this place! It was all true!

Having only been here 5 days I feel deeply relaxed from the treatments, and I have also discussed Ayurveda, the food and the hospitality was also first class – you make a solo traveller feel at home straight away.  Special thanks also for introducing me to Hatha Yoga with such a first-class teacher. I’ll be continuing that in the UK on my journey towards more Mindfulness.

See you next time but with my wonderful Lucy Mether

Thank you!

Dear all from Barberyn,

It was my first experience with Ayurveda treatment. I checked your resort by googling it and found some recommendations. I came here with my two sisters to have 2 weeks of Ayurveda treatments and join the Yoga meditation retreat held by Daphne Williams. It was a wonderful combination as yoga, meditation and Ayurveda belongs together. We are pleased to say Bravo to all your organisation and staff as everything was going on time, smooth, kindly and always with smile and positive energy.

We wish to stay longer.

But definitely we will be back next year.

Your place is unique, very calm and just perfect to get back to health and balance our lives.

Stay as you are and we are looking forward to our next visit!

Ayurveda is a very foreign concept in Saudi Arabia, so I came not knowing what to expect. I mainly came for my parents as they have several health issues, but I realised that it’s for everybody.

Beyond the treatment, the nature, the simplicity, the service, the friendliness of everyone gives you an experience like no other.

Thank you Barberyn…..

And see you again next year.

I was referred to the resort by another South African friend that is a regular visitor. I can go home and give her some good feedback.

And for the food and staff in your restaurant absolute brilliant. I came to the resort with 2 problems. No 1 my sleeping problem. Has been solved, thank you doctor. I had my first good nights sleep last night in months. No 2 to try and loss 2kgs, that did not happen with the delicious food that you serve.

I look forward to returning to savour the delicacies, healthy food, the dining room with the spectacular views of the reef and crashing waves, the comfortable attractive rooms and above all the service and the Ayurvedic medicines and treatments. I will have a happy memories of the wonderful masseurs working together so well and special ambience of the tranquil herb garden and the rhythmic flow of the warm water over me in the herbal bath. The acupuncture, the steam room treatments and other special treatments have been greatly appreciated too. Thank you to the doctors for their expertise and the staff who facilitated a deeply rejuvenating months stay here. Nothing was too difficult to resolve

I stayed at Barberyn Reef Resort around a week. My friend who had stayed here strongly recommended to stay at this resort. She was right!! Staff is very friendly and helpful I felt always welcomed with their smile. Treatment was very professional and I was relaxed. Treated like a princess in the herbal bath with the lady pouring the warm water from my upper body, arm, legs n toes. Nowhere else I would get this treatments. Incredible hospitality!!

The food is excellent!! Was amazed only with vegetables various dishes have been created, and most importantly it was delicious! Healthy too. I am very much looking forward to cooking classes on Monday.

The room was kept clean always and was given hot water and mosquito mat everyday. First time in Sri Lanka, and will not be the last time. Thank you so much for your hospitality!!

_DR UTA HOYER & MS URSULA THIEL(Germany)_

After a long journey and many travels to exotic and beautiful places I found something very special. Inside I felt like a piece of Flotsam and Jetsun worked up on the beach after the storm. This inner turmoil has been calmed and re joined because of the nurturing and nourishment to every part of my being. Even the parts that resisted and held on to the old habits. There is so much kindness, honesty and integrity in the very foundation of this place. All who work here are so generous and giving. So much to thank you all for, from a very grateful and rested traveler.

_Linda Cameron (Cyprus)_

It is first time for me and my mom in your country.

First my mom was hesitating of going to the country so far from Kazakastan.

But now we decided to come back to the place of paradise – Barberyn.

We would like to thank special thanks to all people who made our staying here amazing. There is no word to express our gratitude to the best treatment, best food and best people.

Thanks to all – doctors, receptionists, Yoga teachers, cooks – to everybody.

And see you in 2011!!!

_P.S – we are going back home healthy!_

### Guests comments since re-opening on 1 August 2009

I stayed at Barberyn Reef Resort around a week. My friend who had stayed here strongly recommended to stay at this resort. She was right!! Staff is very friendly and helpful I felt always welcomed with their smile. Treatment was very professional and I was relaxed. Treated like a princess in the herbal bath with the lady pouring the warm water from my upper body, arm, legs n toes. Nowhere else I would get this treatments. Incredible hospitality!!

The food is excellent!! Was amazed only with vegetables various dishes have been created, and most importantly it was delicious! Healthy too. I am very much looking forward to cooking classes on Monday.

The room was kept clean always and was given hot water and mosquito mat everyday. First time in Sri Lanka, and will not be the last time. Thank you so much for your hospitality!!

“here’s to a soulful year”

_I was recommended two charming Sri Lankan seaside retreats, both owned by the family-run Barberyn Resorts, an award-winning pioneer of the ayurvedic retreat concept. I chose Barberyn Reef, a quaint resort near the rolling surf on the island’s south-westen coast, close to the town of Beruwala…_

“An ayurvedic adventure”

_I thought the beauty of the place alone would heal me. The sister resort of Barberyn Reef, the first Ayurvedic resort in Sri Lanka, Barberyn Beach is set on a hillside overlooking a palm-fringed beach. The 15 acres of grounds have been beautifully landscaped, and the views in every direction are stunning. Sitting on the hillside by the pool, you can gaze out at the sea and at the stilt fishermen, perched on their spindly-looking sticks. From the moment I arrived, I was in heaven…_

_Sri Lanka’s superb spa retreats are open for bussiness again following the devastation caused by last December’s tsunami. And visitors to its idyllic spas will help support the country’s recovery. Ulpotha and Barberyn resorts offer some of the finest native ayurvedic treatments, holistic massage, herbal steam baths and yoga on the ‘Island of Serendipity’ Visitors to Ulpotha – a beautiful lakeside hideaway in the rural heart of the country – will be directly supporting tsunami relief efforts through the cost of their stay. Guests staying at the Barberyn Beach and Barberyn Reef resorts will also be supporting its Sahana Foundation to tackle the poverty of local villagers and the Bodhi School Programme to improve affected school._

**“Welligama Wellness Holiday”**

_On a spectacular beach in Sri Lanka an unusual healing resort offers more than a suntan. Chami Jotisilikorn reports on the amazing effects of an all-natural Ayurvedic holiday._

“This is my third time doing a detox holiday at Barberyn resorts, and what keeps me coming back, in addition to getting detoxed, is that I always meet interesting people on every visit.”

The resort in Weligama is the second property in the resort group. The original property is located up the coast in Beruwala, 80 km from Colombo. It was founded 36 years ago by Sudana Roderigo at a time when healing resorts were virtually unheard of. Over the years Barberyn has built a strong reputation and a loyal following of return guests through word of month.

Authentic Ayurveda healing is the total integration of individual diagnosis, daily traditional treatments by trained professionals, the correct diet and proper medications. These provide a holistic life style that’s best experienced in a dedicated environment. When this environment is a spectacular beach setting, it only helps to speed the total healing process.

**“Detox from FESTIVITIES”**

_Joan Koh checks into a week-long ayurvedic retreat in Sri Lanka to discover new meaning to clean living_

There’s much to be said about celebrating the excesses of the season, and the penalties that must follow in order to keep your body in check. Thankfully, compensating doesn’t necessarily have to be painful. With Christmas and New Year behind us, and 15 days of Chinese New Year feasting ahead, it’s best to plan ahead to detox your system – and where better to do so than in Sri Lanka, as I found out.

I consider myself as living rather healthily. I’ve shunned red meat for seven years now and detox with a fruit-and-vegetable diet frequently. I exercise regularly and I know my aging body appreciates it, but a treat at Barberyn Reef Ayurveda Resort is something else.

About 20 minutes drive south of Galle is the Barberyn Beach Ayurveda Resort in Weligama, a place to experience Ayurveda at its best. It opened in February last year and is the sister of Barberyn Reef Ayurveda Resort in Beruwala, pioneer of the Ayurveda resort concept in Sri Lanka more than twenty years ago.

**“Beach Breaks”**

_Beach Breaks_

_A Beach is a beach . Or so you’d think. For something so universal—a stretch of sand and some water—they elicit very personal responses. Here are just a handful of our personal favorites._

A Reef-Freshing Break

At Beruwala, a long reef runs parallel to the beach for 200 meters, creating a protected tidal lagoon like a natural salt-water swimming pool- or one big bathtub.

## Meditation on Loving Kindness with Geetha

This is the video of Geetha’s guided Loving Kindness meditation from Sunday, May 3rd, 2020 – the first Webinar in a series that will continue throughout May 2020, every Sunday, at 11am European Summer Time/10am UK.

Meditation on loving-kindness helps us to overcome emotions such as anger, fear, anxiety which we are all experiencing and which is said to lower immunity. Awakening the compassion within us results in protection for ourselves.

**Understanding Loving Kindness Meditation.**

In meditation we seek to come to the present moment – to be “conscious”. In this meditation,  we focus on our breath, and it helps us to become still and calm.

Once we find our breath and focus on it for a little while, we turn our attention to Loving Kindness – it brings Peace and Strength to the giver and the receiver. We start by feeling kind to ourselves and then move on to our parents, our teachers, our close family, our friends, our enemies and then to the whole wold.  We then bring back all that good energy and loving kindness to ourselves again. You hear four lines being repeated starting with our selves.

May I be well

May I be healthy

May I be happy

May I be free of suffering.

May you enjoy the experience

Sunday Webinar Program for August \| Barberyn Ayurveda Resorts

Sunday Webinar Program for August

# Sunday Webinar Program for August

Ayubowan!

We are happy to let you know that we will continue the **Barberyn webinars** in the month of **August**.

The webinars will continue each **Sunday at 11:00 AM European Summer Time/ 10:00 AM UK** – click here to join

The lineup of webinars in August is as follows:

Sunday 2 August : **Mindfulness practice** with Geetha at Barberyn Reef

Sunday 9 August : **Ayurveda and Forest Medicine** with Dr Pushpa

Sunday 16 August : **Harmony in body and mind**: Yoga with Amesh

Sunday 23 August : **Cooking** with Manick and the Barberyn Chefs

Sunday 30 August : **Everything begins in the Forest** – New Dimensions in

well-being, at Diyabubula, Barberyns Jungle and Art Hideaway.

The first webinar for August will be this **Sunday at 11:00 AM European Summer Time/ 10:00 AM UK** about mindfulness practice. The practice of **Mindfulness** is known to help in resolving common human problems such as stress, anxiety and depression. and help in personality development. These are however fringe benefits in the practice. Mindfulness is, in fact, a spiritual journey that focuses on the deep interconnection between the body and the mind. Mindfulness leads to awareness and this leads to insight – a profound level of understanding that is beyond intellect and can only be known through experience.

Geetha will lead the first webinar and will explain this philosophy in a simple and practical way.

We look forward to practice with you.

Ayurvedic food is both healthy and delicious! \| Barberyn Ayurveda Resorts

# According to Ayurveda, the diet of an individual plays an important complementary role in the Ayurvedic treatment. Therefore, after the diagnosis of the health status   Each guest will be prescribed a diet consistent with the physician’s diagnosis and the recommended treatment.

## You will be surprised –   Ayurvedic food is both healthy and delicious!

The food, which is of six main tastes (sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent and astringent) and many sub tastes, has been mentioned in classicbooks about Ayurveda, some of them up to 5000 years old, along with the food’s characteristic properties: Guna (property), Virya (potency), Vipaka (post digestive effect) and Prabhava (special attributes).

As a result, Ayurveda food has a very important role at Barberyn Ayurveda resorts. This doesn’t mean a strict regime of bland, tasteless or bitter vegetarian dishes, prescribed by physicians. On the contrary, our Ayurveda kitchen is one of our greatest assets, and the dishes our cooks prepare will surprise and delight you every day of your stay!

At breakfast, you’ll find a buffet with fresh fruit, fruit juices, herbal soups, home-baked breads & cookies, as well as a selection of Sri Lankan breakfast dishes. For lunch, we offer a wide selection of mild fish, vegetable and herbal curries, arranged in a beautiful buffet. In the evening, we serve you a set vegetarian menu with a fish option. On Saturdays we celebrate “Sri Lankan night” with an extended buffet – our chefs prepare typical local dishes right in front of your eyes.

In Ayurveda, there are many classifications for food and beverages –depending on taste- properties, depending on the body’s ability to digest and metabolize food, beneficial in specific disease conditions, depending on seasons to consume specific food etc. As we consider all these aspect at the same time, a conscious attempt is made to include all tastes in every meal – in specific combinations for each individual.

**We serve fresh vegetables, fruit and also fish. We do not serve meat or alcohol.**

At Barberyn Ayurveda Resorts, you will always find an Ayurvedic doctor or dietician at hand during meal times. He/she will advise you on the suitability of specific vegetables, herbs and spices and help you select/avoid dishes according to your prescribed treatment. Your personal herbal elixir and the instructions from the doctors at the health centre will be on your individual table.

**This care and attention to diet is unique to Barberyn Ayurveda resorts.**

The food is considered as the Prana (life sustaining energy) for human beings, that is why you should eat every meal consciously experiencing the aroma-taste -its pleasant warmth and mouth watering sensations.

At Barberyn Beach Ayurveda Resort we conduct daily yoga classes in the morning and evening for beginners and intermediate students. Our yoga teachers are qualified from the Sivananda School of Hatha Yoga.

Barberyn Yoga class is designed to complement the Ayurveda treatments. We mainly focus on synchronizing the breathing and yoga posture. For experienced yogis, they can hold the Yoga Asana for a longer period as long as they’re comfortable. Our teachers emphasize on proper relaxation, at the beginning, end and in between yoga postures to improve mental relaxation, reduce stress, prevent formation of lactic acid and prevent fatigue after class. Our guests who practice daily yoga feel energized, more focused and do not feel tired after the class. Practicing daily yoga asana and pranayama helps Ayurveda medicine to become more effective in treating certain conditions such as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Constipation, Stress, Insomnia and it makes you happy.

” Health is Wealth , Peace of Mind is Happiness, Yoga shows the way! ” Swami Vishnu-devananda

well-being, at Diyabubula, Barberyns Jungle and Art Hideaway.

The first webinar for August will be this **Sunday at 11:00 AM European Summer Time/ 10:00 AM UK** about mindfulness practice. The practice of **Mindfulness** is known to help in resolving common human problems such as stress, anxiety and depression. and help in personality development. These are however fringe benefits in the practice. Mindfulness is, in fact, a spiritual journey that focuses on the deep interconnection between the body and the mind. Mindfulness leads to awareness and this leads to insight – a profound level of understanding that is beyond intellect and can only be known through experience.

Geetha will lead the first webinar and will explain this philosophy in a simple and practical way.

We look forward to practice with you.

Barberyn Sands is located on a peninsula between the Bentota River and the Indian Ocean, just opposite the town of Bentota, a drive of approximately 100 km from Colombo International Airport. It opened in December 2017.

**Bentota Town** is a vibrant coastal town, a popular tourist destination. It offers a post office, banks, a tourist office, a government handicraft shop, and a teashop. There’s a “bazaar” (a place where locals shop) and an open “wet market”, where one can buy fruit or vegetables. Bentota Town is just a short walk or ferry ride away.

## EXCURSIONS / Day Trips

Barberyn also arranges short excursions to places of interests in the vicinity on most afternoons of the week. These excursions are free of charge to resident guests.

#### More information

- **The Galapota Temple**, a few kilometres inland, on the south bank of the river, said to date from the 12th Century.
- **Warakagoda Temple**, a small cave temple, and you can see tea and rubber plantations as well as village hamlets en route. The tour includes a visit to a nearby “tourist village” where you can see traditional crafts being produced.
- **Bawa’s Brief Garden**, ten kilometers inland from Bentota. It used to be the home of Bevis Bawa, the older brother of internationally renowned Sri Lankan architect Geoffrey Bawa. His house is the highlight of the tour: the artwork on display is eclectic, including a piece from one-time house guest Donald Friend. Entry is Rs.1,000. The garden is open from 8am to 5pm daily.
- **Gangatilaka Vihara**, South of the Kalu Gaga Bridge, on the main road. It is a hollow dagoba (Buddhist Shrine) with an interestingly painted interior.
- **The Kechimalai Mosque**, said to be built on the site of the landing of the first Arabic merchants. It is the focus of a major festival at the end of Ramadan.
- **The Turtle Sanctuary** at Induruwa
- **River cruises:** meander along the Bentota river in a motor boat, and enjoy the clear expanses of water and the gentle passage through low hanging foliage.
- **Galle Fortress town:** The port of Galle, a key city in the South of Srilanka and a World Heritage Site, is thought by some to be the Biblical city of Tarshish. Galle splendidly illustrates the Dutch presence in Sri Lanka. The 36-hectare (89 acre) Dutch Fort, built in 1663, has withstood the ravages of time. Its massive ramparts surround the promontory that forms the older part of Galle, and shelters within its walls sturdy Dutch houses, museums and churches. This area has a relaxed atmosphere and a quiet buzz that seems almost detached from the flow of history. On the way, we stop at the Ambalangoda mask making factory.
- **Wet market:** Visit the wet market in a three-wheeler, and watch people buying vegetables, fruits and daily ware. Browse around and get a feel for the locality and the people.

# Barberyn Ayurveda Therapy

## Ayurveda has become a household name with all those interested in “alternative medicine”.

**Yet Ayurveda is not an alternative medicine. It is one of the oldest forms of medical science known to man – originating 5000 years ago.**

**It is a way to a healthy and long life and can complement modern medicine.**

## Ayurveda therapy has two main objectives:

- **to treat the symptoms of a disease and**
- **to help individuals to strengthen their immune system.**

Ayurvedic medicine treats body, mind and spirit of a person as a whole entity.It works on the basis that mind and body affect each other, and together can overcome disease.

## Illnesses treated at Barberyn

### Ayurveda – the Science of Life – has existed for more than 5000 years.

It has two main aims:

- **to maintain the health of healthy beings**
- **to treat diseases of the ailing**

At Barberyn, we acknowledge both these aims with equal care and responsibility.

Ayurvedya Chikitsa (Ayurvedic treatment) has eight main branches which are further divided into sixteen sub branches. The treatment is not aimed at simply relieving symptoms, but to bring back the balance of physical-mental and spiritual aspects of an individual.

If you have any specific medical condition, the physicians will explain to you how the condition is understood in Ayurveda as to the etiology, its signs and symptoms, the stage of the disease, relieving and aggravating factors , what is beneficial and what is not, and – most importantly – what would be the best line of management of the condition.

### Here are some specific examples & explanations of illnesses that have been frequently treated at our resorts:

## Ayurveda treatments at Barberyn

### Ayurveda gives equal importance to the maintenance of health and the curing of a disease. It does not simply suppress the disease, but rather aims at removing the disease from its root.

Ayurvedic principles state that the imbalance of the three biological energies (Tri Dosha) creates a disease – due to years of poor diet, weak digestion, improper metabolism and incomplete elimination of waste matter, inadequate sleep, pollution, stress and production and accumulation of bio-toxins (Ama) etc.

During the initial Shodana (purification) process, these toxins are collected from various parts of body and expelled through the nearest outlet. Then, the Shamana (pacifying treatment) or the rejuvenating treatment will have better and long lasting effect on body.

Ayurvedic principles state that the imbalance of the three biological energies (Tri Dosha) creates a disease – due to years of poor diet, weak digestion, improper metabolism and incomplete elimination of waste matter, inadequate sleep, pollution, stress and production and accumulation of bio-toxins (Ama) etc.

### Ayurvedic treatment has 2 basic aspects:

### 1\. Shodana Chikitsa

This is the internal purification process unique in holistic treatments. It is said that vitiated Dosha – once it has been removed – will not create diseases again. The purification process is ideally done in three stages. The total process requires a minimum of two to three weeks.

For those unable to stay two weeks or more, the doctors at the health centre will draw up a treatment plan incorporating the most important purification therapies – in accordance with the needs of your body and the duration of your stay.

**The purification process has three stages**

- **Purva Karma:** (preparatory procedures) – Oleation and fomentation procedures.
- **Pradhana Karma:** (main purification procedures) – The main Panchakarma procedures consisting of Vamana, Virechena, (Anuvasan and Niruha) Vasti Nasyam and Rakta Mokshana as per the individual requirement.
- **Paschat Karma:** (post-purification procedures) – the post purification regime followed by Shamana (pacifying) or Rasayana (rejuvenating) treatment.

### 2\. Shamana Chikitsa

This type consists of the pacifying therapies for manifested diseases. Both internal and external therapies consisting of herbs, minerals and other biological products are used individually or in compound formulae. Many illnesses like allergic conditions, skin diseases and neurological conditions – where western medicine has no current standard treatment – can be managed through simple herbal treatment.

### An individual treatment plan may consist of a judicious combination of the wide variety of therapies available in Ayurveda as mentioned below.

_Click on the therapies to get detailed explanations_

Shareera Abhyanga (Body massage)

Abhyanga is indicated daily for a healthy individual, especially in neuro-muscular diseases (Vaata Vyadhi); it is done with herbal oils as mentioned in Ayurveda. Abhyanga strengthens and tones up muscles, removes fatigue, improves blood circulation, improves sleep, revitalizes the body and delays geriatric changes. The selection of the type of oil depends on the condition of the body, diagnosis of the physician. The duration of the treatment is usually 30-40 minutes.
Shiro Abhyanga (Head massage)

A head massage with application of medicated oil. Shiro Abhyanga improves the eye sight, color, texture and volume of hair, strengthens the musculature of head, neck and shoulders, removes headache, brings good sleep, relaxing and helps delaying decline of sense organs and aging. It is useful in Vaata Vyadhi (neurological conditions), Ardita (facial Paralysis), Pakshaghata (Hemiplagia) and ShiroRoga (different types of headaches).
Acupuncture

Acupuncture treats patients by insertion of solid, generally thin needles into the body. It integrates meridian distribution, reflexological concepts, the trigger point model, and anatomical insights (such as dermatome distribution) for insertion of needles. Acupuncture’s greatest effectiveness appears to be in symptomatic control of pain and nausea, insomnia, weight loss etc.
Akshitarpana (Nourishing Eye treatment)

Parisheka (Sprinkling of herbal decoction on body)

A similarly prepared lukewarm herbal decoction is sprinkled on the body of the patient. Different types of decoctions are used, according to the ailment.
Vashpa Swedana (full body fomentation)

Herbal roots, leaves and other raw materials are boiled in water. The whole body is exposed to the medicated steam for a prescribed period of time. It is highly beneficial for neurological and degenerative conditions (Vata Vyadhi), muscular pains and overweight conditions.
Nasya Karma (Nasal treatment)

Medicated oils, herbal extracts, powders etc. are administered through the nasal orifices in a specific dose and for a specific duration. This treatment is effective for chronic sinusitis, chronic headaches, migraine, facial paralysis, nasal congestion and diseases of eye, nose, ear, mouth and head.
Patra Pinda Swedana (Poultice fomentation)

This oil massage along with fomentation is done by application of poultice (prepared of herbal leaves) on the body. It is indicated for degenerative joint disorders like spondylosis, arthritis, ankylosis (Vata Vyadhi), paralytic conditions (Pakshaghata), muscular pain and acute pain conditions.
Shashtika Shali Pinda Sweda (Milk rice bolus fomentation)

Oil massage along with fomentation is done by application of poultice (prepared of rice cooked in milk and herbal decoction) on the body. It is indicated for degenerative and geriatric conditions of joints and muscles (Vata Vyadhi), muscular dystrophies (Mamsagata Vata) etc.
Sarvaanga Dhara – Pizhichil (whole body oil fomentation)

Pouring of lukewarm medicated oil on the whole body with synchronized massage for a specific time period is known as Sarvaanga Dhara. It is useful for Hemiplegia, Hemiparesis, degenerative joint disorders like spondylosis, arthritis and acute pain related conditions like tennis elbow, frozen shoulder, sprains (all these come under Vata Vyadhi in Ayurveda).
Kati Vasti (keeping medicated oil on back for a prolonged time)

A circular ridge is made with black gram paste on the back of the patient. Lukewarm medicated oil is poured and held for a stipulated period of time. This is useful for spondylosis, ankylosis as well as a deviation of inter-vertebral discs etc..
Shiro Pichu (application of medicated oil patch on head)

In this procedure, a piece of cotton or natural cloth is dipped in oil and kept on either head or on certain other parts of body for a stipulated period of time. It is useful in many stress related mental disorders (Mano Roga) as well as geriatric diseases, muscular stiffness and neurological conditions.
Shirodhara (methodical flow of medicated liquids on head)

Shirodhara is a procedure consisting of continuous pouring of medicated oil onto the forehead of the patient for subsequently increasing duration of time. The medicated oil or the medicated liquid is chosen as per the disease and body type of person.

Shirodhara is an excellent Ayurveda therapy for stress management, relaxation and for the treatment of diseases connected with head, neck, eyes, ears, nose, throat as well as neurological conditions like paralysis, migraine, insomnia, Parkinsonism, Cerebral atrophy, tinnitus etc (Vata Vyadhi).
Shiro Vasti (keeping medicated oil on head for prolonged time)

Keeping oil over the head with the help of a special leather cap for a stipulated time is called Shiro Vasti. Lukewarm medicated oils are poured into this special leather cap. The duration of the treatment and the type of oil varies according to the patient and the type of disease.

This treatment is highly useful for facial paralysis (Ardita), certain types of headaches (Shiro Roga), degenerative neurological conditions (Vata Vyadhi), chronic insomnia (Anidra), mental stress and certain psychological disorders (Mano Roga).
Vamana Karma (Emesis Therapy)

Vamana is the first and foremost of Panchakarma therapies, designed to remove the vitiated Dosha (especially vitiated Kapha Dosha) through the oral route. In this procedure, vitiated Dosha (accumulated biological toxins and residual matter) are brought to the stomach and expelled through vomiting. It is useful in treatment of Ama related conditions (bio-oxidants), bronchial asthma, indigestion (Agni Mandya), overweight condition, other certain respiratory tract related diseases and psychological disorders. As this is a major Panchakarma procedure, administering the procedure is totally dependent on the decision of the consulting physician
Virechana Karma (Purgation Therapy)

This is the second Karma in the chronology of Panchakarma. It aims at bringing out the vitiated Dosha (especially vitiated Pitta Dosha) from the lower end of the digestive tract (anal route). It is indicated for the treatment of metabolic disturbances (Paitika Vyadhi), overweight condition (Medo Roga), certain ano-rectal conditions, chronic constipation, indigestion (Agni Mandya) etc. As this is a major Panchakarma procedure, administering the procedure is totally dependent on the decision of the consulting physician.
Vasti Karma ( Medicated Enema Therapy)

In Ayurveda, medicated enemas are mainly categorized as oil enemas or decoction based enemas. Vasti, which is administered through the anal route, is an unparalleled therapy useful for a multitude of diseases, as it directly stimulates the gut brain. Therefore it is useful in many neurological, metabolic, degenerative, reproductive, and psychological as well as gastro-intestinal disorders. But beneficial results will only be experienced if a careful after-therapy regime is followed for a stipulated time period. As this is a major Panchakarma procedure, administering the procedure is totally dependent on the decision of the consulting physician

Quality control is done throughout the cycle. Pure natural ingredients enhance the quality of the medicine that Barberyn provides to its guests.

# Barberyn Webinar Video: Mindfulness Practice

The practice ofMindfulnessis known to help in resolving common human problems such as stress, anxiety and depression. and help in personality development. These are however fringe benefits in the practice. Mindfulness is, in fact, a spiritual journey that focuses on the deep interconnection between the body and the mind. Mindfulness leads to awareness and this leads to insight – a profound level of understanding that is beyond intellect and can only be known through experience.

Geetha explains this philosophy in a simple and practical way.

## Webinar Video: Ayurveda Cooking Demonstration

The Ayurveda medicine that we drink (Decoctions, powders and pills and sweet elixirs) are plant-based. Individually and in combination these plants have unique properties that help in preventing and curing disease. Ayurveda food is also plant-based. And each of these plants and their combinations have medicinal values. This is why we hear from the physicians that “we are what we eat” or more precisely “we are what we digest” When the food is fresh, cooked with compatible ingredients and prepared in accordance with the principles of Ayurveda, food becomes medicine. Medicine becomes food and nourishment.

In this webinar, we share with you some of the dishes you have come to love at Barberyn Kurakkan Roti, Lunumiris, and rice flour pudding. They are easy to make, nourishing, wholesome and tasty. Try making them and you will taste your reward.

## Barberyn Webinar Video: Cooking Demonstration

### Manick – How to Cook Healthy & Tasty Food

- We have come to this point of culinary development from a diet of mainly raw leaves.
- In the early times we adopted a simple style of cooking which was boiling all the ingredients together and this still remains with the Soup which is also a basic dish in the west.
- Bringing the food to a boiling point and simmering on low heat is the basis of Sri Lanka cuisine and the curry, as with the soup. Coconut milk and the spices add flavor and nutrition to the Curry.
- Rice also follows this same method. People are moving away from this slow-cooking methods
- Because of the fast pace of life and we are fortunate that the method still prevails and there is a greater awareness in preserving the value and nourishment of the ingredients.

## Webinar Video: Practice Yoga Asana with Amesh

At Barberyn Beach Ayurveda Resort we conduct daily yoga classes in the morning and evening for beginners and intermediate students. Our yoga teachers are qualified from the Sivananda School of Hatha Yoga.

Barberyn Yoga class is designed to complement the Ayurveda treatments. We mainly focus on synchronizing the breathing and yoga posture. For experienced yogis, they can hold the Yoga Asana for a longer period as long as they’re comfortable. Our teachers emphasize on proper relaxation, at the beginning, end and in between yoga postures to improve mental relaxation, reduce stress, prevent formation of lactic acid and prevent fatigue after class. Our guests who practice daily yoga feel energized, more focused and do not feel tired after the class. Practicing daily yoga asana and pranayama helps Ayurveda medicine to become more effective in treating certain conditions such as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Constipation, Stress, Insomnia and it makes you happy.

” Health is Wealth , Peace of Mind is Happiness, Yoga shows the way! ” Swami Vishnu-devananda

Reading Room IN SEARCH OF WISDOM \| Barberyn Ayurveda Resorts

## The concept of well-being at Barberyn Reef Ayurveda Resort has three dimensions – healing the body, developing clarity of the mind and enhancing spiritual awareness and compassion.

Barberyn is operated by a family who cares about other people. They want their guests to feel good, physically and mentally, and be stronger and better equipped for their daily life. They encourage those who come to Barberyn to reflect on the gift of life and living.

Guests are thus free to use the owners’ collection of materials on Eastern and Western spiritual philosophies and self-knowledge. These materials, including books by prize-winning authors, are available in the reading room.

Guests can also borrow videos on self-knowledge and inner contentment – as well as popular movies.

## Webinar Video: Ayurveda Cooking Demonstration

The Ayurveda medicine that we drink (Decoctions, powders and pills and sweet elixirs) are plant-based. Individually and in combination these plants have unique properties that help in preventing and curing disease. Ayurveda food is also plant-based. And each of these plants and their combinations have medicinal values. This is why we hear from the physicians that “we are what we eat” or more precisely “we are what we digest” When the food is fresh, cooked with compatible ingredients and prepared in accordance with the principles of Ayurveda, food becomes medicine. Medicine becomes food and nourishment.

In this webinar, we share with you some of the dishes you have come to love at Barberyn Kurakkan Roti, Lunumiris, and rice flour pudding. They are easy to make, nourishing, wholesome and tasty. Try making them and you will taste your reward.

## Barberyn Webinar Video: Daily Routine in Ayurveda

### **Learn the Daily routine in Ayurveda with the Barberyn Physicians** at the Home of Barberyn’s Institute of Ayurveda and Alternative Medicine.

The beautifully restored 100-year-old house is the backdrop where the Physicians are explaining the routine – the _**Daily Routine**_, _**Seasonal Routine**_ and the _**Code of Conduct**_ which enables us to maintain a healthy way of life.

They will also demonstrate an Ayurveda oil application that you can practice on your self or your loved ones.

#### **Doctors Script:**

Ayubowan!

I am Dr. Haresha, a researcher from Barberyn Ayurveda Resorts and Institute of Ayurveda and Alternative Medicine. In the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak, Dr. Chamal and I researched Covid-19 with the Ayurvedic medical system.

Five thousand years ago, our great sages had spoken about such infectious diseases as _Janapadodwansa_ diseases. Sage Charaka says this is mainly due to moving away from a healthy state. My colleague Dr. Pushpa has already explained about a healthy person described in Ayurveda.

We all know that prevention is better than cure while there is no medicine for Covid-19 as of now, we have found several important facts regarding the current outbreak through our research. Some of them are proper & nutrient food, a healthy lifestyle, a pleasant mind, and good immunity. Among them, enhancing the body’s natural defense system (Immunity) plays a vital role in maintaining optimum health.

ILLNESSES TREATED AT BARBERYN: SCIATICA (BACK PAIN) \| Barberyn Ayurveda Resorts

# Illnesses treated at Barberyn: Sciatica (Back pain)

### Name of medical problem: Sciatica (Back pain)   Ayurveda name: Gradhrasi

**Cause of illness:** According to Ayurveda, Sciatica is usually caused by an increase or aggravation of “vatha dosha”. The buttocks and part of the thighs and legs are serviced by the Sciatica nerve. Pressing of the Sciatica nerve and inflammation of the areas surrounding the Sciatica nerve lead to this medical condition. The damage of the Sciatica nerve slows down or prevents conduction of impulses through the nerve.

Damage to the Sciatica nerve can be caused through strenuous activity such as lifting weights or over-exposure to cold wind. Prolonged sitting or lying with pressure on the buttocks may also damage the nerve. Systemic diseases such as diabetes can typically damage many different nerves, including the Sciatica nerve. The Sciatica nerve could also be injured by fracture of the pelvis, or other trauma to the buttocks or thighs.

**Symptoms:** Back pain experienced in the region of the buttocks, the back of the thigh or the leg. Patient experiences difficulty walking.

- Sensation changes in the back, in the calf or the sole of the feet
- Numbness and decreased sensation
- Tingling and burning sensations
- Mild or severe pain
- Weakness of the knee or foot resulting in difficulty in walking
- Inability to move the foot (severe case)
- Inability to bend the knee (severe case)

## Ayurveda Treatments:

In Ayurveda, Sciatica is treated with a combination of internal herbal pills, herbal decoctions and elixirs/ wine, and external oil applications and hot fomentation.

### Internal treatment:

- Herbal pills called “Yogaraja Guggulu”. Guggulu is a resin obtained from the tree Camphora Mukul, found in South Asia. The Yogaraja Guggulu is made by making a paste of Guggulu resin, 25 types of herbs, and ghee. The medicine is very effective in the treatment of all pains of the nervous system.
- Herbal elixire/wine called the “Dashamula Arishta”. This elixir contains about 63 herbs, plums, juggery (molasses), honey and water. The name “Dashamula” comes from the fact that it has ten main component herbs (dasa in Sinhala means ten). The medicine has an anti-inflammatory property. It tones up the nerves and helps the nerves to work more effectively.
- Fresh herbal decoctions prepared by boiling a large number of dry and fresh herbs (at times up to 20 compounds). Depending on the patients’ condition, these decoctions also help to reduce the pain associated with the disease.
- To avoid constipation, which often aggravates the symptoms, Castor oil is prescribed for internal use with the decoctions. Castor oil is a good purgative and has the qualities of reducing the effect of constipation associated with Vata Dosha.

### External treatment:

- External oil application on the painful parts of the body, particularly the back region, buttocks, and part of the thighs and legs with the medicinal oil called “Sarshapadi”. This medicinal oil is prepared with the base of mustard oil, camphor and vegetable turpentine
- Hot fomentation of the painful parts with the help of “Bolus” or bundles of fresh and dry herbal parts and sea salt wrapped in cloth.
The oil massage and the fomentation improves the blood circulation, stimulate and strengthen the nerves and reduces the aggravated Vatha Dosha and helps to reduce the pain.

**Prospects of cure:** Data analyzed shows that the majority of the patients were cured of the disease. A cure takes about 4 weeks of treatment. Almost all the patients experienced reduction of symptoms. Reduction of symptoms was seen after about 2 – 3 weeks of treatment.

## Meditation on Loving Kindness with Geetha

This is the video of Geetha’s guided Loving Kindness meditation from Sunday, May 3rd, 2020 – the first Webinar in a series that will continue throughout May 2020, every Sunday, at 11am European Summer Time/10am UK.

Meditation on loving-kindness helps us to overcome emotions such as anger, fear, anxiety which we are all experiencing and which is said to lower immunity. Awakening the compassion within us results in protection for ourselves.

**Understanding Loving Kindness Meditation.**

In meditation we seek to come to the present moment – to be “conscious”. In this meditation,  we focus on our breath, and it helps us to become still and calm.

Once we find our breath and focus on it for a little while, we turn our attention to Loving Kindness – it brings Peace and Strength to the giver and the receiver. We start by feeling kind to ourselves and then move on to our parents, our teachers, our close family, our friends, our enemies and then to the whole wold.  We then bring back all that good energy and loving kindness to ourselves again. You hear four lines being repeated starting with our selves.

May I be well

May I be healthy

May I be happy

May I be free of suffering.

May you enjoy the experience

The first webinar for August will be this **Sunday at 11:00 AM European Summer Time/ 10:00 AM UK** about mindfulness practice. The practice of **Mindfulness** is known to help in resolving common human problems such as stress, anxiety and depression. and help in personality development. These are however fringe benefits in the practice. Mindfulness is, in fact, a spiritual journey that focuses on the deep interconnection between the body and the mind. Mindfulness leads to awareness and this leads to insight – a profound level of understanding that is beyond intellect and can only be known through experience.

Geetha will lead the first webinar and will explain this philosophy in a simple and practical way.

We look forward to practice with you.

#### **Doctors Script:**

Ayubowan!

I am Dr. Haresha, a researcher from Barberyn Ayurveda Resorts and Institute of Ayurveda and Alternative Medicine. In the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak, Dr. Chamal and I researched Covid-19 with the Ayurvedic medical system.

Five thousand years ago, our great sages had spoken about such infectious diseases as _Janapadodwansa_ diseases. Sage Charaka says this is mainly due to moving away from a healthy state. My colleague Dr. Pushpa has already explained about a healthy person described in Ayurveda.

We all know that prevention is better than cure while there is no medicine for Covid-19 as of now, we have found several important facts regarding the current outbreak through our research. Some of them are proper & nutrient food, a healthy lifestyle, a pleasant mind, and good immunity. Among them, enhancing the body’s natural defense system (Immunity) plays a vital role in maintaining optimum health.
